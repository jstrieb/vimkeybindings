## Install

Download and install the extension
[here](https://github.com/jstrieb/vimkeybindings/releases/download/v2.1.0/vimkeybindings-2.1.0-fx.xpi).
It is only available on this page, not on the Firefox add-on store.

## Supported Commands

* gg : go to the top of the page
* G (shift-g) : go to the bottom of the page
* gt : go to the next tab
* gT : go to the previous tab
* {n}gt : go to the nth tab

Commands can be repeated as in vim. Example: 50j will scroll down 50 lines.
